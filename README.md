# Credit_Card_Financial_Dashboard
This project involves developing a Credit Card Transaction and Customer Dashboard using Power BI to provide a comprehensive overview of customer spending behavior and transaction patterns. The dashboard aims to offer clear, data-driven insights into credit card usage, helping financial institutions or businesses better understand their customersâ€™ habits, preferences, and overall transaction trends.

By visualizing key metrics such as transaction volumes, spending categories, customer demographics, and payment trends, the dashboard empowers decision-makers to monitor real-time data and detect emerging patterns. It also includes features like filters for specific time periods, geographical regions, and customer segments, allowing for a more granular analysis. The end goal of this project is to enhance customer relationship management, optimize marketing strategies, and ensure financial security by identifying unusual or potentially fraudulent transaction activities.
